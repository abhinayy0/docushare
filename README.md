<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Launch the app and go to the server and just start using.

### Prerequisites

Install your dependencies using pip.

- pip
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Installation

Setting up the server locally.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abhinayy0/docushare.git
   ```
2. Create a virtualenv.
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment if you're using it. Install requirements

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Make sure you're in the same working directory as your start.py before executing the command.

5. Launch using
   ```sh
   python start.py
   ```
6. Now your app should be accessible at

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8000
